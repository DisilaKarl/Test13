Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing [describe the type of data, e.g., "sales data from a retail company", "customer feedback data", or "financial data from a specific industry"]. The main objective of this analysis is to [mention goals, e.g., "uncover trends", "predict future outcomes", or "identify factors influencing a particular outcome"].

Dataset
Source: [mention the source, e.g., Kaggle, government database, or a company-provided dataset]
Description: Briefly describe the dataset, its main features, and any relevant details, such as:
Number of observations
Number of features
Types of features (e.g., categorical, numerical)
Time period the data covers, if applicable
